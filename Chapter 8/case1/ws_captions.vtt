Caption 1
00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
We observe today

Caption 2
00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
not a victory of party,

Caption 3
00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
but a celebration of freedom -

Caption 4
00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
symbolizing an end,

Caption 5
00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
as well as a beginning -

Caption 6
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
signifying renewal,

Caption 7
00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
as well as change.

Caption 8
00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
For I have sworn before you

Caption 9
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
and Almighty God

Caption 10
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
the same solemn oath

Caption 11
00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
our forebears prescribed

Caption 12
00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
